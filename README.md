# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a simple classification model for the Iris dataset using a Decision Tree classifier. The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks, and the goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Overview

The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Using this dataset, we train a Decision Tree classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.
